simple-boilerplate
==================

A simplified version of the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). That project is great and really shows you what a production-ready boilerplate looks like. It also has a lot of stuff and can be confusing (with all of the grunt and bower etc files). 

The purpose of this is to just give you an HTML file you can use as a basic starting point with the understanding that you will add content, CSS and much more as you build out your project.
